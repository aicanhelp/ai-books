# AI-Books

This repository is about the technology articles, opensource tutorials and opensource books:
 - (1) **Content Directory:** I often obtain the knowledge and technology I want to know from the internet. When I found something particularly useful, I want to keep it for a long time, rather than just bookmark the entire link. Then, I copied all these good contents and put them in the Content directory.  
 - (2) **Resource Directory:** There are many useful tutorial documents or open source technical books on GitHub. Too many, forks and stars are difficult to manage. So, I will clone them as a submodule and put it into the resource directory.
